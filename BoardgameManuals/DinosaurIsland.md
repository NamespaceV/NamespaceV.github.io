# Dinosaur Island 

This game lets you run your own Jurasic Park. 

You collect dinosaur recipe, collect genes, construct dinosaurs, attract tourists, provide security (so that tourists don't get eaten by dinosaurs),
make more cash, buy more dinosaurs, after enoug objectives are claimed, whoever scores the most points wins.


## Setup

### Per player

Cash: Start player 15, next players one more (16,17,18)

Workers: 4

Genes: Basic 1, limit is 3 (black cube blocks 4), Advanced 0, limit is 1 (black cube on 2)

Other: 1 basic dino (1 threat), 10 VPs, total threat is 1, security is also 1

### Global

Objective Carsds: number of players + 1 

(pick short, medium or long game deck to set different game length, main difference is higher numbers to meet e.g. get 5, 7  or 10 dinosaurs)

Plot twist cards: 2 (if drawn cards don't make sense together, shuffle 2nd card and draw again)

When drawing attraction tiles (rectangular park tiles with meeple sapces on them and coin cost) only during setup - sort them bycost and put cheapest attractions on cheapest upgrade cost.

## Phase 1 Reaserch

You have 3 reaserchers with strength 1,2 and 3. They can:

### 1.1 Get a dino recipe.

Each round there is one herbivore that requiers 1 strength to pick, one small carniovore that requires 2, and one large carnivore that requires 3.
Place the new dino tile in the park, it has space for a single dino. (If it's still empty when game ends -10 VP , but its only at the end of the game)
DO NOT reveal a new dino, there is only one available per type per round.

### 1.2 Get genes from gene die

Dinos cost genes to create. Pick a die and multiply the amount shown on the die by strength of reasercher. Thats how many genes you get.
But black cubes are limit and all genes above are wasted.

There are two special die faces - "increase space on dino tile" and "get a worker". Those require 3 strength to get and you only get 1 not 3.

### 1.3 Increase gene cap

Increase gene limits by moing black cubes. Move by total of your resercher strength.

### 1.4 Pass

Your resercher does nothing, but they will behave like an extra worker in phase 3.

### End of phase 1

One unused die with the most dots sets threat modifier for this round, the more dots the more angry dinosaurs are and more security is needed. Threat be explained in phases 3 and 4.

## Phase 2 Upgrades

There are two rounds of buying upgrades.

Each player can 

- buy one of 3 types of upgrades
- buy more genes and discard an upgrade
- pass and get 2$

Types of upgrades:

- Specialist - put in one of 3 slots next to your board. They often give you an extra worker. And have a text with a special ability.
When you have 3 and hire more you have to get rid of an old one and lose any workers or abilities it provided.
- Lab upgrade - put tile on your lab board. You have 2 spaces for lab upgrades. You can overbuild your lab upgrades with new ones when you run out of space but you lose the old one. 
2 yellow lab spaces cannot be overbuild with gray tiles, but they can be upgraded. Upgrades are always available and cost 3$ and 5$.
2 basic gray actions cannot be overbuild and it would generally not be a good idea to overbuild them even if allowed
- Attraction - build things for tourinsts. The cost is increased by cost on the tile. You get some extra points at the end of the game.
But thoise are mostly to get points from tourists that wanted to see a dino but there was not enough space for them.

## Phase 3 Workers

- activate yor lab upgrades with workers, each lab upgrade says what it does

Core lab upgrades your workers can use from the start of the game:

- create a dino - you need a space for dino and genes to create it, after creating a dino increase excitement (triangle) and threat (dots)
- increase security - pay according to new track space to move security die (if you dont have enough security some tourists will be eaten in phase 4)
- build padlocks for dinos - increase space for dinos on a tile, each starts with one space, take tile with one more space and pay depicted cost
- mix genes - exchange 2 specific basic genes for 1 advanced gene
- get money

All spaces can only be used the amount of times equal to number of spaces, and some spaces require more workers. Only increase security or build padlock is not limited.

Other lab upgrades say what they do on the tile.

## Phase 4 Tourists

### Dinosaurs create excitement

Excitement is created mainly when you create a dino and should be reocrded on the excitement track. This is the amount of meeples you draw from the bag, your basic income and limits points per round.

Drawing red meeples is bad news, they are hooligans, they dont pay $ they don't score VPs, they cut lines to get first, and they run faster from dinos when someone gets eaten.

Earn money for all yellow meeples (usually excitement - #hooligans).

Place meeples into the park spaces. Each dino can entertain one meeple. Each attraction can entartain as many as there are spaces. Hooligans cut lines and need to be assigned first. Other meeples didnt get into the park (but still payed).

Check threat and security (remember to include one unused die with the highest threat). For each point missing dinos eat one tourist. Hooligans run faster so they will be eaten last. For each meeple eaten lose 1 point (plus the meeple wont produce VPs), hooligans still lose 1 VP when eaten (and can only get eaten when all yellow meeples in the park were already eaten)

Yellow meeples still in the park get bonus based on the space. Usually 1VP, sometimes 2$. Hooligans score nothing.

## Phase 5 Clenaup

- check for game end
- All tourist meeples go away
- get your workers and scientists back
- adjust player order based on VPs scored (last player goes first, on tie keep old order)
- reroll gene dies
- discard 2$ cost upgrades
- move all other upgrades to cheaper spaces, and fill the blanks with new upgrades
- reveal new dino for each pile where recipe was taken


## Phase Objectives and game end

- When you meet the objective place your color marker on the objective
- It can still be claimed this phase, but becomes unavailable for other players next phase
- Do not score VPs immediately, they will be added when game ends
- If all but one objectives are scored (#player count) the game will end at the end of the round

Final scoring

- now add points from objectives
- add points per dino shown on dino tile
- add points on attraction tiles
- add 1 VP per 5 $

Whoever scored highest is the winner

If tied, who has most money is the winner
