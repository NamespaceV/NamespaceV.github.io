# Dinosaur Island 

This game lets you run your own Jurasic Park. 

You collect dinosaur recipe, collect genes, construct dinosaurs, attract tourists, provide security (so that tourists don't get eaten by dinosaurs),
make more cash, buy more dinosaurs, after enoug objectives are claimed, whoever scores the most points wins.


## Setup

Cash: Start player 15, next players one more (16,17,18)

Workers: 4

Genes: Basic 1, limit is 3 (black cube blocks 4), Advanced 0, limit is 1 (black cube on 2)

Other: 1 basic dino (1 threat), 10 VPs

## Phase 1 Reaserch

You have 3 reaserchers with strength 1,2 and 3. They can:

### 1.1 Get a dino recipe.

Each round there is one herbivore that requiers 1 strength to pick, one small carniovore that requires 2, and one large carnivore that requires 3.
Place the new dino tile in the park, it has space for a single dino. (If it's still empty when game ends -10 VP , but its only at the end of the game)

### 1.2 Get genes from gene die

Dinos cost genes to create. Pick a die and multiply the amount shown on the die by strength of reasercher. Thats how many genes you get.
But black cubes are limit and all genes above are wasted.

There are two special die faces - "increase space on dino tile" and "get a worker". Those require 3 strength to get and you only get 1 not 3.

### 1.3 Increase gene cap

Increase gene limits by moing black cubes. Move by total of your resercher strength.

### 1.4 Pass

Your resercher does nothing, but they will behave like an extra worker in phase 3.

## Phase 2 Upgrades

There are two rounds of buying upgrades.

Each player can 

- buy one of 3 types of upgrades
- buy more genes and discard an upgrade
- pass and get 2$

Types of upgrades:

- Specialist - put in one of 3 slots next to your board. They often give you an extra worker. And have a text with a special ability.
When you have 3 and hire more you have to get rid of an old one and lose any workers or abilities it provided.
- Lab - put tile on your lab board. You have 2 spaces for lab upgrades. You can overbuild your 2 gray lab spaces or one of the upgrades. 
2 yellow lab spaces cannot be overbuild with gray tiles, but they can be upgraded. Upgrades are always available and cost 3$ and 5$.
- Attractions - build things for tourinsts. The cost is increased by cost on the tile. You get some extra points at the end of the game.
But thoise are mostly to get points from tourists that wanted to see a dino but there was not enough space for them.

## Phase 3 Workers

## Phase 4 Tourists
